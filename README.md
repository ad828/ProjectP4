#ProjectP4

This was my semester project for my first semester Web Development project here at NJIT. It's a webpage that relies on HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap. 
It's a concept for a movie theater that shows the different types of films that are shown on its site.
I had alot of fun with this for my first semester I learned alot of basic web development.

This is the prerequisite for IS219, I will be taking that in S2022 and I will have a more significant web development project.
